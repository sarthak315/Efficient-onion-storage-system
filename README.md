# Efficient-onion-storage-system
In this project I have created an Efficient storage system for onions. Here ideal conditions for onion storage are maintained interms of humidity and temperature.When the onion gets spoiled gases like ammonia and carbon dioxide are detected by sensors embedded in this system and a alert is generated.
